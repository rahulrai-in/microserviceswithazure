## The Event Sourcing Pattern
Learn the internals of this pattern in Chapter 8 of [Microservices with Azure]((https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/microservices-azure)

## Code
You can clone\download the code sample for this pattern from this link: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Azure/tree/master/Chapter08

## Scenario
By nature, actors are single threaded and support turn based conucrrency. You can use this pattern to queue messages to actors that they can process asynchronusly without blocking the client. To demonstrate this pattern, we will build a Microservice that can count the number of pixels in an image and detect the number of pixels of a certain color. The client should not have to wait for the actor to finish processing and should be able to view the progress that the actor is making with the operation.

## Solution
The sample application consisits of an actor that traverses the pixel matrix of an image and classifies the pixels. To simulate a long running process, a the worker thread has been deliberately made to wait.


If you launch the application on your system now, you can view the participant Microservice methods at the Swagger endpoint: http://localhost:8443/swagger/ui/index

## Implementation Overview
Let's take a quick walkthrough of how the solution works.

### Ingestion
When a new product arrives in the inventory, a `POST` request is sent to the the `Inventory` controller.

![Inventory Post Request](/images/InventoryPostRequest.png)

The various parameters of this method are: *productId*, which is the unique identifier of a product, *productName*, which is the name of the product, *suplierName*, which is the name of supplier who sent the product to the warehouse and, *warehouseCode*, which is the code if the warehouse that is going to store the product.

### Shopping
After the product is available in the inventory, a customer can purchase it. After a successful purchase, the `POST` method of `Shipping` controller is invoked. The parameters of this method help recognize the product, warehouse, and customer name. All these parameters are necessary to ensure that correct product is shipped to the right customer.

### Shipping
After the product has been shipped, the product might or might not reach the destination. If the product has been successfully delivered to the customer, the customer acknowledges the receipt by invoking the `POST` method of the `Customer` controller. This method accepts the *productId*, which is the identifier of the product and *customerName* which is the unique name of customer buying the product (assuming that other relevant details such as shipping address and payment are taken care of).

Alternatively, the shipment might not succeed, and the customer might request for another delivery attempt. This request is made through `POST` method of the `Customer` controller. The various parameters of this method help identify the shipment for which the customer is requesting another delivery attempt.

### Audit
An administrator or a customer support personnel might want to track the lifetime of a product in the system. The lifetime events of an item can be tracked by invoking the `GET` method of the `Audit` controller. This method requires a unique code of the entity being tracked as the *correlationCode* parameter value, which in our case is the identifier of the product.

![Audit Get Request](/images/AuditGetRequest.png)

The code of all the controller methods is similar except that of the `AuditController`. Let's see how events are generated by looking at one of the methods, the `POST` method of the `ShippingController`, which is as follows. 

```
var product = new Product(this.CacheProxy) { Name = productName };
var wareHouse = new Warehouse(this.CacheProxy) { Name = warehouseName };
var customer = new Customer(this.CacheProxy) { Name = customerName };
var result =
    await this.EventProcessor.Process(
        new ShipFromWareHouseEvent(DateTime.UtcNow, product, wareHouse, customer));
return this.Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, result);
```
This method gets the relevant details from the datastore (in our case the Redis cache) and invokes the `ShipFromWareHouseEvent` event. The `Process` method of `EventProcessor` ingests an event and simply stores it in the append only event store (SQL database). Note that we are not storing the current state of the entity anywhere because we can simply retrieve the last event from the Event Store and recreate our entity.

```
JObject result;
using (var scope = new TransactionScope())
{
    using (var store = Initializtion.InitEventStore(this.connectionString))
    {
        result = await @event.Process(); // Allows the entity to carry out processing requirements such as removing article from inventory
        var streamId = @event.Id;
        using (var stream = store.OpenStream(streamId, 0))
        {
            stream.Add(new EventMessage { Body = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(@event) });
            stream.CommitChanges(Guid.NewGuid());
        }
    }

    scope.Complete();
```

Finally, let's go through the `AuditController` which parses the Event Store to fetch entity states. The `GET` request to this controller, invokes the `ReadStream` method. This method queries the Event Store for all the events associated with a particular identifier and responds with a snapshot of the entity states.

```
var response = new List<string>();
var resolvedEvents = new List<EventMessage>();
using (var store = Initializtion.InitEventStore(this.connectionString))
{
    using (var stream = store.OpenStream(streamId, 0))
    {
        resolvedEvents = stream.CommittedEvents.ToList();
        foreach (var @event in resolvedEvents)
        {
            response.Add(JObject.Parse(@event.Body.ToString()).Property("Message").Value.ToString());
        }
    }
}

return response;
```
The **Client** project is simply a UI wrapper over the *CommerceService* so that we can get some visual feedback on the operations that the user is carrying out.

### Output
It's time to test our application. Simply launch the **EventSourcing** Service Fabric application and wait for it to get ready. Next, launch the **Client** application. Note that if the endpoint of your **ControllerService** is different from that configured in the client, you can change it in the `appsettings` file of the client.

Let's first bring a new item in the inventory. Fill out the details in the client and click the **Add To Inventory** button.

![Add Product](/images/AddProduct.png)

You can track the status of the product at any point of time in the status box. This box also represents how the record would look in a traditional database that does not use Event Sourcing.

![Database Status](/images/DatabaseStatus.png)

Next, let's simulate a customer purchase. In the **Product Purchased** section, enter your name and click on the **Ship to Customer** button.

![Product Purchased](/images/Product Purchased.png)

Assume that shipment failed and the customer has requested for reshipping the item. To request reshipping click on the **Reship** button.

![Reship](/images/Reship.png)

Finally, assume that customer has received the shipment. Let's confirm the receipt by clicking on the **Delivered** button.

![Delivery Received](/images/Delivery Received.png)

An auditor can track the lifetime of the item by clicking on the **Audit Lifecycle** button.

If you want to extend the system and recreate the product state at any point in time, you can easily do so from the Event Store using the NEventStore APIs.
