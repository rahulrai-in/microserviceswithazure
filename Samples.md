## About
We have discussed several Microservice architecture patterns in our book [Microservices with Azure]((https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/microservices-azure). In this section, we will discuss how we can realize some of the key architecture patterns that we covered in the book.

## Code Repo
All the samples are documented at the Packt's GitHub Repo available here: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Azure](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Azure)

## The Patterns
Navigate through the patterns under the "Samples" section in the menu to view the list of patterns for which practical code samples are available. A description of how to build the sample and test it is available in the respective pattern sample page.
