## About
We have discussed several Microservice architecture patterns in our book [Microservices with Azure]((https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/microservices-azure). In this section, we will discuss how we can realize some of the key architecture patterns that we covered in the book.

## Code Repo
All the samples are available for download at the Packt's GitHub repository available here: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Azure](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Azure)

## The Patterns
Navigate through the patterns under the **Samples** section in the menu to view the list of patterns for which practical code samples are available. A description of how to build the sample and test it is available in the respective pattern sample page.

> The accompanying code samples are have been deliberately made simple and straightforward to make help the readers understand the underlying architecture pattern with ease. In enterprise scenarios, we recommend that you accompany architecture patterns with appropriate design patterns to make your solutions maintainable and robust.
